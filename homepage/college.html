                    Playing Division 1 college hockey is probably the hardest out of all college sports to play. There are currently 62 D1 teams, but that number will float around anywhere from 60-64. With each team having around 28 kids, that is only 1736 kids give or take playing D1 college hockey a year. Considering that includes around 6 different age groups, the vast majority of hockey players will never touch
                    the D1 level. In terms of recruiting, every team has about 18 scholarships to give out, but have upwards of 28 players per season. Many players will not get scholarships but can still play D1 hockey and maybe even earn one. There is also no tryouts or anything for D1 hockey. If you are being recruited you'll know, and during your senior year if the school offers you you can sign a NLI, or National Letter
                    of Intent, commiting yourself to that school. Until then, you can verbally commit to the school if the coaches decide to offer you before the NLI date. Many of D1 athletes also come in much later, with the average age of a freshman being around 20.5 years old. Everyone that plays D1 hockey is going to be one of the best ones on their team, and almost every single one of them plays at least one year of junior hockey, with some playing up to 3. Playing D1 hockey is immensly time consuming, but should you get a chance
                    to it is one of the most rewarding experiences in the world.

                Division 2
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="below">
                    Division 2 hockey is interesting. There is only 7 teams, and they will sometimes play both D1 and D3 teams. Overall, D2 hockey isn't as big as D3 in all honesty, but one thing they have that beats out D3 is they still have scholarships. Regardless of how many teams are in D2 hockey, to get free college and play the best game on earth is still a sweet deal. Anyone playing NCAA hockey is at the very very top of
                    the game, and the talent in D2 is still immense. Many of these players still will have to play juniors and also come in later than the average freshman. D2 hockey still takes a ton of effort, and almost everyone who plays says it is an amazing experience. No matter how many teams there are don't shy away from D2 hockey as it is an awesome experience still.

                    Division 3 college hockey is still incredibly intense and out of all D3 sports it may be the most competitive. The biggest difference with D3 is they have no scholarship spots. That means two things. First, you won't be getting any money for playing your sport. Secondly, you will still have to pass admissions standards for the school so make sure you keep your grades up. D3 admissions sort kids into a banding system.
                    There are A, B and C band kids based on grades. Each school has different standards that decide which band you will fall into, but what matters is every coach can take many A bands, a few B bands, and maybe 1 or 2 C bands. The biggest thing for D3 hockey is grades grades grades. D3 hockey is just as intense as many D1 teams, and again many kids still go to juniors before they play. It is one of the best experiences someone can have
                    and if you have a chance to play D3 hockey I implore you to take it. It can also give you an education that you may not be able to get without hockey.

            <p class="below">
                ACHA hockey is the level below NCAA, and is classified as a club sport. Do not let that turn you off from it though, as ACHA hockey is still a great way to continue your career. The ACHA runs 3 divisions, but unlike NCAA Division 1 does not always mean the best. Actually, 2 teams in Division 2 are ranked 1 and 2 out of all the leagues. The ACHA still gets a ton of fans in many of the bigger colleges like ACC and SEC schools. For kids that
                cannot get a NCAA offer but still love the game, playing ACHA hockey is still a great experience and the level is suprisingly high.

            <p class="below">
                CHF hockey is very similar to ACHA, just run by a different, newer orginization. Unlike the ACHA the CHF is not sanctioned by USA Hockey, but is run about the same. The CHF also has a very high level of hockey, and while there is a high variation of talent there are still very good players throughout the league. A CHF team is even thinking about moving up to D1 NCAA,
                and it shows how this is a up and coming league. For club hockey the CHF is a great league and many great schools are a part of it.
