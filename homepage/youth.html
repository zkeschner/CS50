            <b>Tiers</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-size: .5em">
            The basic structure of youth hockey is a tier system. These tiers are either Tier 1 or AAA, Tier 2 or AA, or finally Tier 3 or A. Tier 1 is the best and Tier 3 is the so called "worst". All of these are valid to play as youth hockey is for fun and growth, and does not have to be the most competitive. However, if you plan on playing AAA hockey, the work is intense and you have to be very dedicated.

        <b>Mites</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            Mite Hockey is where almost everyone's journey will start. Mite hockey is for players 8 and under, and is the first "competitive" hockey many people will play. This is also the point where many people will start to
            need a USA hockey registration number, which can be aquired <a href="https://membership.usahockey.com/"> here</a>. The most important thing people need to know about mite hockey is it doesnt really matter. Many people will
            try to get on a top tier mite team, and take private lessons every day. The truth is the kids are 8 or even younger. Focus more on making them love the game and learn the basics and forget about the stupid rankings etc. that are
            prevelant even in mites.

        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            Squirt hockey is the next step in the youth hockey circuit. This encompasses 10U hockey, and is the start of full ice hockey as mites sometimes are half-ice games. Squirt hockey is essentially the same as mites, where in the actual games don't matter
            much, and the only importance is to improve basic hockey skills, and cultivate the love of the game.

            <b>PeeWee</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            PeeWee hockey is next after Squirts. This is ages 11-12 or 12U. This is the last stage before checking comes in, so it's crucial for kids to have mastered the basics of stickhandling, shooting, skating etc. This is the age where kids and parents should start
            planning for either a jump up a level, or find the best team they can be on for bantam. Body contact training is also important. While hitting isn't allowed yet, learning how to safely hit and get hit is important. Controlling your own body is paramount to safely playing the game.

            <b>Bantam</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            Bantam is the first step into "real" hockey. Hitting is now allowed, and recruiting for prep school and higher level team begins here. Kids are still young, but now is the beginning of higher level training. Advanced systems, higher level skills and advanced skating
            are beginning to be implemented here. Body contact gets exponentially more important as you get older, so learning at this level is very important.

        <h1>
            <b>Midget</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            Midget is the age where kids and families really need to start making decisions. Kids still at the Tier 2 level either need to make the jump to Tier 1 or continue their career just for fun, and kids at Tier 3 should focus on enjoying the rest of their hockey career and
            maybe exploring ACHA opportunities. For kids at the Tier 1 level, recruiting really ramps up. Prep schools, junior teams, and college scouts will be at many Tier 1 games. Those all are explained in these pages: <a href='juniors.html'>Juniors</a>, <a href="prep.html">Prep</a>, and <a href="college.html">College</a>.
            For those looking to move on to the next level, this is the level where you should still have a good amount of success, and be one of the top kids on your team. Many kids don't get recruited from midget, so work to getting to a good Prep or U18 team first and foremost.

            <b>U18</b>
        </h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: .5em; margin-left: 20px">
            U18 is the last level of youth hockey. Most kids here will either go on to Prep / Juniors or end their careers (<i>No Pressure</i>). Many Prep teams will still be recruiting for either Senior or PG years. Junior teams will be recruiting heavily, but that is a long and confusing process.
            Finally, college scouts will be all around U18 hockey. Don;t worry, many kids won't be recruited out of U18, but they will definetly talk to you and it's important to go to good camps over the summer to up your exposure. Work hard, and take the best chances you can find.
