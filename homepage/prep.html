            Prep school is a common step to take either after midget or U18 hockey. It's actually the route I myself took in my career. This is one of the most interesting paths people can take due to it's many different facets. There's the cost for one, along with living away from home at a school and the shorter season + split season.
            In this article I will try and explain the different factors of prep and prep hockey in general. Nobody can make a decision for you and your family, but having as much information is crucial for making the best decision possible.

            For the purposes of this article, I will only be talking about the New England prep circuit, and the NEPSAC, or New England Prep School Athletic Council, is the governing body of almost every prep hockey team in New England. There are many different leagues in the NEPSAC, and to find out about the leagues and teams in them
            click <a href="https://www.nepsac.org/page/3318">here.</a> These leagues and the teams in them each have their own pro's and con's and this should be one of the first things you should look at when choosing a school.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Tournaments</h2>
            <p class="below">
            There are 3 major tournaments for prep hockey, and while each school plays in a league, outside of league playoffs these tournaments are the only playoffs many teams will play in (If they make it). These tournaments are: Large School, Small School, and Elite 8.
            The Elite 8 is for the top 8 teams in all of prep hockey, regardless of small or large school. The most recent winners were Salisbury in 2021-22. After that there are the large and small school tournaments. Each school is outlined into either large or small school, designated
            <a href="https://www.ushr.com/assets/docs/2021/NEPSAC-Small-Large-School-Breakdown-2021-10-09-16-38-05.pdf">here.</a> To qualify for these tournaments, a team has to be ranked top 8 in their division, excluding teams in the Elite 8. Large school teams play in the large school
            division, and same for small schools. During the regular season's teams can play any school regardless of size or league, but the playoffs are seperated by school size

            <h1 style="text-align: center"> <em>Prep School Life</em></h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">Social Life</h2>
            <p class="below">
                The biggest change in life at boarding school is the social scene. Living away from home, managing time, etc. Overall there are 3 things I'd focus on when it comes to living away from home at prep school. The first thing is time managment and sleep. Managing time at school can be difficult at first.
                Sometimes there are days where you feel like you have all the time in the world, and others where you feel you don't have a second to breathe. When you get up to school for the first time, know the basis and backbone of your days. Know when school, meals, sports etc. generally start, and then map your days around
                that. Once you know what time is definetly blocked off, it is much easier to plan the rest of your day. The next thing is food. While this seems obvious, it is a crucial part of school ecspecially for athletes. Many schools have food that is mediocre at best, horrid at worst. Many schools also are in places where you
                either can't order/drive for food. My advice is to have good, healthy snacks that fill you up like nuts and jerky in your room, as well as microwavable food on days where you need a "real" meal. The final things I would focus on is making sure you find some sort of comfort at school. That can be friends, a special place at school,
                or something that can calm you down or make you feel better. Living away from home is tough, and being alone on those tough days can take a toll on people. Having something consistent to fall back upon, ecspecially during the season, is something I feel is very important for everyone.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">School Work</h2>
            <p class="below">
                School work is the other huge change when going to prep school. For some people the work gets exponentially easier, and for some much harder. A big change is you will no longer have parents looking after you every night and making sure you get your work done. That means it is imperitive to know what work you need to get done,
                and also you need to make time and effort into doing all your work. Keeping some sort of calender or agenda is something I definetly recommend. Another difference is you can definetly use your teachers more. You will probably be living with many of them, and most prep school teachers are willing to go above and beyond for their students.
                Make sure you utilize these teachers, go to extra help, etc. As long as you put in the extra effort to use your teachers for help and use the time given to you by the school to do work (for example study hall), you will be fine with your work. The most important thing is although you will be there for hockey, focusing on academics is hugely important
                ecspecially for people looking to get recruited to college.
