            Navigating Juniors is a mess. That is the first thing everyone needs to know before even planning to play juniors. The second thing is the 3 tiers (sorta) of Junior hockey and the many many leagues in those tiers.

                Tier 1
            </h3>
            <p class="below">
                There is only 1 junior league that is technically "Tier 1". This would be the <a href="https://www.ushl.com/">USHL</a>. There really is nothing much to say about this league besides that it is the best league in North America, and 99% of kids in it play D1 college hockey and many get drafted.
                If you are going to play in the USHL you'll already know. If you can get a foothold in these league do it, because you're pretty much garunteed a college commitment.
            </p>
            <h3 class="centered">
                Tier 2
            </h3>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="http://nahl.com/">NAHL</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The NAHL is arguably the second best junior league in North America. The NA is known as a tough, gritty league. The NA is physical, dirty, and overall one of if not the toughest junior league to play in. However, it is still one of the top junior leagues and is more then worth playing in.
                Over half of the kids in the NA play D1 college hockey, and almost all the rest play D3. Any that don't either choose not to or play top tier ACHA. The NAHL is a very well run league and is tuition free just like all Tier 1 and 2 leagues in America. They also have a feeder league, the NA3HL,
                which will be talked more about later. Overall, if you can play in the NA and feel you can handle the physicality, it is definetly a top tier league. They also have teams all over the country so you can find a team close to where you live if you want, or you can billet as most kids do. Many kids that
                actually end up playing in this league are either drafted or tendered, so be careful of going to camps with the expectation of making these teams unless you have spoken to the coaches,

            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.usphl.com/ncdc">NCDC</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The NCDC is the other Tier 2 junior league in America. The NCDC is part of the USPHL, a very large league encompasing youth and junior hockey. Like the NAHL it is tution free, but is based out of just the east coast instead. While the NCDC is not quite as good as the NAHL, it is still a top
                tier league. Like the NAHL, a majority of the players in the NCDC play college hockey, but compared to the NAHL there is more D3 as opposed to D1. But playing in the NCDC is a great way to move on to college hockey, and if you find a team that feels right for you, this is definetly a great league.
                Also, unlike the NAHL, many more people sign tenders and play without getting drafted, so this is a little bit easier to get a foothold in but to make one of these teams you likely would need to be talking to the coaches a lot beforehand.

                <a href="https://bchl.ca/">BCHL</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The BCHL is a little bit different. It is not techincally a Tier 2 league because it is in canada and they have a different structure there, but for our purposes I will rank the canadian junior leagues where they should be more or less according to the american tier system. The BCHL is right up there
                with the NAHL, probably slightly better then the NCDC. It is not exactly tuition free, but the fee is miniscule. The BCHL is based out of british columbia, so it is definetly an adjustment ecspecially for people coming from america. The BCHL is part of canada's junior A league, so players are eligible
                to play college hockey still. The BCHL sends hundreds of kids onto play colelge hockey, and for people that are ok moving to canada (or live there) and find a good opportunity to play for a team they like, the BCHL is a great option comparable to the NAHL
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.ajhl.ca/">AJHL</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The AJHL is based out of Alberta, and is another canadian league. This league is probably more comparable to the NCDC as opposed to the NAHL, and like the BCHL it is also basically tuition free. The AJHL sends many kids off to play college hockey, but like the NCDC they send a few more to D3 than the BCHL.
                Overall, this league like the other Tier 2 leagues is a good, well run league that is scouted heavily and will give you a great opportunity to move onto college hockey. Before you choose to play here, make sure you have a good spot ecspecially if you are from america because to move countries is very difficult
                and it is important that you know you will get the most you can out of it.

                Tier 3
            </h3>
            <p class="below">
                Tier 3 hockey is interesting. Many leagues here are more or less not worth it, but many can also feed into higher tier leagues. Be very careful playing in these leagues, but they can still be a good opportunity to move on to college hockey.
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.easternhockeyleague.org/">EHL</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The EHL is an interesting league. They have a bunch of commits, but are pretty much exclusivly D2 or D3. About half of the kids in this league fizzle out though, and it is not tuition free so be wary. You may spend thousands and take a year off before college
                only to be left with nothing. However, many EHL teams have ties to higher tier teams, and there is most definetly room for people to move up to higher leagues for a chance at a better commitment. Tier 3 juniors is always a risk, but if you choose to take that risk
                the EHL is likely your top choice.
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="http://na3hl.com/">NA3HL</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The NA3HL is almost primarily a feeder league to the NAHL. Almost all commits directly from the NA3 are either D3 or ACHA. If you choose to play in this league, I suggest you should be talking to the NAHL coach that is affiliated with you team and making sure there is a chance
                to move up. Be careful as many coaches can BS you into just taking your money, so make sure there is a real shot at moving up. If you just plan on playing Tier 3 juniors and going to college, I would recomend another tier 3 league but this definetly can be a route to higher level juniors.
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.usphl.com/premierdivision">USPHL Premier</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The USPHL Premier is the league below the NCDC that is part of the USPHL. Similar to the NA3HL, this is a feeder league to the NCDC. Most of the commits straight out of this league are either D3 or ACHA. Before playing in this league make sure you have a route to either a better tier 3
                junior league or into the NCDC. This is a well run league, but players playing here for their older years probably should look to ACHA colleges if they cannot move to higher juniors.
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.usphl.com/elitedivision">USPHL Elite</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                This league is basically just for fun. If you have any aspirations of moving on in hockey, do not play in this league unless have a very direct route into moving up.
            </p>
            <h4 class="centered">
                <a href="https://www.cjhlhockey.com/en/">CJHL (minus BCHL and AJHL)</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="below">
                The rest of the canadian junior a leagues all fall around under the tier 3 level. Each has their own benefits and disadvantages and some are definetly better then the others but not by a very large margin. These leageus can 100% move you up or on to college directly, but there is a bigger risk involved
                here than tier 2 hockey. Some leagues, like the CCHL still get good scouting while others do not. Make sure if you choose to play junior A hockey you have clear goals you want to achieve, and research the team and league you may play in to see if those goals are possible. Overall, most Junior A leagues would
                probably be better the USPHL Premier or NA3HL, but make sure before you choose any league you do extensive research and talk to the coach of a team plenty to know if you should choose that place or not.
